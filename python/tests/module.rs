//! The `collomatique` module, exercised from real python scripts
//!
//! The scripts live in `tests/scripts/` as `.py` files rather than as string
//! literals: they are the thing under test, and a real file is what a user
//! writes. The rust side passes inputs in and reads results out through the
//! script's globals, so the assertions stay here, where a failure says
//! something useful.
