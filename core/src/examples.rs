//! Examples of [crate::BaseProblem] and [crate::ProblemConstraints] implementations
//!
//! This module defines a few simple examples of implementations for [crate::BaseProblem] and [crate::ProblemConstraints].
//! This is used mostly for documentation on their usage together with [crate::ProblemBuilder] and [crate::Problem]
//! but also in order to be able to write tests.
